# shopify-liquid

This package is **DEPRECATED**, use [liquidjs][liquidjs] instead: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/liquidjs>

Migration to liquidjs should be smooth. `liquidjs` is more consistent with the Ruby version, with additional features like AJAX partials, format string for the `date` filter, and more.

[liquidjs]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/liquidjs
